## Principle

UFO is a collection of security features which help developers to improve de security of a web application. 
It's not really a framework, because it's not designed to create a beautiful web site with least efforts.
But the collection provide some additional mechanisms in order to help the developer to use it.

## Use case

UFO shall help to :
- Detect the use of not sanitized inputs
- Implement access control management like RBAC or ACL
- Implement customized session management
- Implement schema data and users isolation (use several database users and shema for differents actions : CRUD, user management, session, ...)
- Make resilient application by combining AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) and Exception Management
